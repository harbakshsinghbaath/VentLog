# 😤 VentLog

VentLog is a personal online journal where you can rant, vent, and express your feelings once a day. It's a safe space just for you — or optionally, a place to anonymously share your thoughts with others. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), VentLog helps you turn daily frustrations into healthy habits.
